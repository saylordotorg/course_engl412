This course will introduce you to the range of drama written and
performed in England and Continental Europe between roughly 1660
and1800, a period often termed “the long eighteenth century.”  In this
course, we will refer to the “long-eighteenth century” as the period
that began with the Restoration of the English monarchy with King
Charles II following the English Civil War and concluded with the first
years of the nineteenth century.  During this period, drama flourished
in England, France, and Germany.  After quite a long period in which
theater was not in vogue, the emergence of brilliant new dramatists, the
development of novel forms of plays (including derivates of the Italian
opera, comedy, and the musical), and the passage of laws that finally
allowed women actors on stage sparked renewed interest amongst
theatergoers.  In this course, we will explore the major plays, players,
and playhouses from this era in conjunction with a thorough and in-depth
historical contextualization. This course has been arranged to first
acquaint you with the broader socio-historical and literary context in
which Restoration and eighteenth-century drama burgeoned and
flourished.  We will begin with a detailed introduction to the
Restoration era, which will discuss the causes of the English Civil War,
the Stuart Restoration of King Charles the II, and the social, cultural,
political, and scientific dimensions of Restoration life.  Once we have
historicized the Restoration, we will do the same for the
eighteenth-century, focusing on the English monarchy, the “Scientific
Revolution,” and the Enlightenment as well as the variety of new forms
of theater that emerged and developed during this dynamic and exciting
age.  Subsequent units of the course will focus on Restoration and
eighteenth-century drama from various nationalistic perspectives
(English, German, and French).  Here, we will investigate—among other
genres—English Restoration and Sentimental comedy, Heroic and Pathetic
drama, political satire; the German “Sturm und Drang” tradition; and
French Harlequin theater.
