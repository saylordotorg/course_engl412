*In the last unit, we studied English drama through a variety of lenses
(cultural, political, generic, social).  In this unit we will turn our
attention to simultaneous developments in the theater of Germany during
the long-eighteenth century.  Here, we will explore the “Sturm und
Drang” tradition in Germany as well as German historical drama and
tragedy of the period.*
