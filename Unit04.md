**Unit 4: French Drama: Harlequin Comedy & Other Genres** <span
id="4"></span> 
*In this unit, we will expand our nationalistic perspective on the drama
of the long-eighteenth century to include work created and performed in
France.  In so doing, we will investigate the joys of the Harlequin
comedy of Pierre de Marivaux as well as the historical and philosophic
drama of Voltaire.  Our course concludes, then, by rounding out the
various genres that we have studied thus far by approaching theater from
the stance of two of France’s most important dramatists of the period.*

-   Describe the nature of eighteenth-century French drama and
    especially the theater of Harlequin comedy.
