**Unit 1: An Introduction to Restoration & Eighteenth-century History
and Culture** <span id="1"></span> 
*The English Civil war erupted as a result of disputes over the proper
role of the monarchy in Britain.  While “Royalists” supported King
Charles I, “Parliamentarians” pushed for a voice for the nobility and
the people of England.  Ultimately, England saw the rise of Oliver
Cromwell, the murder of the king, and the emergence of England’s first
Commonwealth and Parliament.  The Parliamentarian victory was relatively
short lived, however, as King Charles II was “restored” to the throne in
1660 and a new “Restoration Era” ensued.  In this unit, we will examine
the history of this period in England with a focus on the politics,
science, and culture of Restoration England.*

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**
